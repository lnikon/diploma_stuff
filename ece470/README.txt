SUMMARY
=======

This is the C++ skeleton of the logic and fault simulator
required to be implemented as part of PROJECT 1, ECE-470
at North Dakota State University.

It contains the basic classes to build the circuit netlist
and the parser to read in the netlist from a file.
The circuit testcases are in tests/ directory.

To compile on a Linux machine type:
> make
To execute it type for example:
> simulator tests/circuit_1.map

To compile and run on a Windows machine you will have to do 
the things required by your IDE that you'd use.


TODO
====
You will have to develop on top of this skeleton the following:
1)  Logic simulator
2)  Fault simulator
3)  D or PODEM algorithm
